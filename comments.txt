- Single Time Step prediction is enough?

- Can I use additional data?

- Standardization or Normalization? 
    - Standardization: Rescales values, s.t. mean=0 and std=1
        - Assumes Gaussian distribution
    - Normalization: Rescaling values to [0,1], not as robust
        - Acceptable to use max and min of training data?

- Can Reinforcement Learning be used for anything relevant in the job field? (self driving cars)

- Can he show us how he worked his way through this problem?

- Handin as jupyter notebook okay?

Try to explain a nice story.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
- How do I compare the effect of different normalization/standardization options on the model since the mean absolute error is depending on it?

- Sarima really closely models the graph even though it is non-constrained (or whatever the right word for that is)
=> Plan Forward: 
    - Get the proper prediction for LSTM working
    - Get the GRU stuff going (low priority)
    - Get a nice comparison between each individual method
    - Maybe extend the data?


Less weights
Other data
More dropout? Maybe try feedforward
